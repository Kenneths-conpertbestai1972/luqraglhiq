OMG just got out of Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy and wow, my head is spinning like a blender full of marmalade. Y'know that feeling when the credits roll and you're just kinda stuck to your seat with popcorn bits on your lap and your back’s all stiff like you’ve been folded into origami for two hours? That’s me right now. 

Bridget is back and she's like this whirlwind of awkwardness and charm—like if you threw a cocktail party but forgot the cocktails and ended up with a farmyard of butterflies instead. Crazy, right? There's this one scene where Bridget's trying to do yoga and I SWEAR, it’s like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a giraffe learn ballet. My laugh was so loud, some dude in the row ahead turned to me, his glare like a librarian with WiFi down. I mean, wow, get a grip, right?

> Oh, the soundtrack! Felt like a mash-up of 90s vibes meeting a 𝘮𝘰𝘥ern remix. Flashbacks to those high school discos where you wobbled on the dancefloor but more Bridget-style, so less dance and more stumble.

Sidenote: was it you who asked if it’s better to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   later? Coz you gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it, feels like gulping fizzy drinks on a rollercoaster.

Colin Firth was, I dunno, like a stale crumpet? He’s there, but you’re craving something with a bit more jam, you get me? And then Patrick Dempsey, who just waltzes in all McDreamy but with this puzzled, “am I in the right  ?” look half the time. It’s chaos, but good chaos, like trying to stuff too many marshmallows in your mouth on a Saturday night just because.

The theater was packed, btw, and there's this kid behind me crunching nachos like a frikkin’ caterpillar munching through a forest. Man, I can still hear it.

Definitely give it a go if you're like spaghetti for plots and don’t mind a bit of sauce flying everywhere. My brain’s just unraveled spaghetti right now, honest.

    for(let i = 0; i < heartBeats.length; i++) {
        let confusion = Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'jumble' : 'tumble';
        console.log(confusion);
    }
}
